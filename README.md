# Vision-Sensory-Substitution-Device
C++ code intended to run on an Arduino. The Arduino receives input from an Android phone via Bluetooth and outputs a Braille representation of the text received using an array of motors. Because of the limited number of motors (6), the Braille representation is incomplete and cannot display certain characters.
The Arduino also takes input from an ultrasonic distance sensor, outputting a distance-dependent frequency of sound using a piezo buzzer.
